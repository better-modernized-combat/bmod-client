    - Xenos NPC accuracy was too high, it's been lowered to more reasonable levels now so you should be able to survive in more situations like when you're outnumbered.
    - Added a new shipline modelled by our new collaborator, McDyson! Meet the Manta, Angler and Orca fighters in the hands of Xenos NPCs, or buy them on the Xenos's Ouray station. They're slightly flimsier in some ways than the civilian Falcon line, but they have a more flexible hardpoint setup.
    - Implemented a full new system of discovering dynamic events and points of interest by interacting with (and potentially hacking) useable terminals found in space across Colorado, thanks to IrateRedKite's very hard work. These terminals, tagged with [USE] at the start of their name, can be interacted with by selecting them and typing `/terminal use` or `/terminal hack`, for legal and illegal options respectively. These interactions give the player information on interesting things, events and opportunities to make a profit. Legal use cost credits, while hacking may trigger consequences from the terminal's owning faction. Type '/terminal show' to review the information you've recieved.
    - For this first implementation, there is only one active terminal to interact with, a DSE mineral scanning radar that can be found between Planet Denver and the Cheyenne asteroid field. It can provide information on profitable mining, salvage and other opportunities it detects through geological analysis. Many more terminals and events will be added soon that cover many different types of gameplay, including trading, exploration, bounty hunting, research, and combat.
    - Made ores and gems sell for better prices.
    - Added a new Support Turret tool, a mining beam intended for CSVs and Rhinos to use in cutting up ore-carrying rocks and salvageable wrecks at point blank range. For sale on Denver and Pueblo.
    - Made it so [+] gear doesn't cost absurd amounts to repair anymore, this was unintended.
    - Added new [+] gear for sale on Pueblo, inculding enhanced variants of Autocannons, MGs, Lasers and PPCs.
    - Ammo for [+] weaponry added to all stores for convenience.
    - Lowered the sizes of the Mule group spawns a bit.
    - NPCs should spam less Cruise Disruptors at you, reducing their obnoxiousness.
    - Repair gun range was doubled.
    - Tweaks to Xenos weapons loadouts, including less lasers across the board for all pilots except for Elites.
    - Light Fighters had their agility nerfed somewhat.
    - VHFs recieved a small buff to their top speed.
    - Added a roundabout way to start a pirate character, just shoot up the crates on the cargo depots outside Planet Denver until you're neutral with Xenos (and red with the Navy.)
    - The Rhino has been resized and had it's shape and hardpoints adjusted slightly to better fit fleet-sized gear.
    - New models for launched SRMs and LRMs that can properly be shot down with weapons fire. This is especially useful for Rhino players who can use point defense guns to protect themselves from these missiles.
    - New models for some fighter auxilliary gear: Machine Guns, LRM pylons and SRM pylons should now have distinct models.
    - Shields added to DSE Mining Ships and the Xenos Ludlow frigate.
    - In addition, big upgrade to the Xenos's Ludlow frigate in general, as along with a new shield and a new model (Thanks McDyson!), it has a completely frigate-appropriate weapons loadout which provides massively increased lethality.
    - Fixed problems with how destructible solars like the Ludlow frigate would respawn wrong and not drop loot. They should now blow up properly, only respawn on server restarts, and have their loot drop consistently when killed.
    - First Torpedo implemented, the Skipper Light Torpedo, an L Missile weapon intended for hunting freighter sized targets. Sold on most bases in Colorado.
    - Added bomber-style loadouts as an alternative spawn for Xenos VHFs. They can now spawn with PPCs and Torpedoes for hunting freighters.
    - Adjusted buy and sell prices of commodities and etcetera across all bases in Colorado, including the addition of proper sell prices to Ouray base for pirate players.
    - Changed the appearance and behaviour of any newly created MP characters from this point on - they will appear as anonymously helmeted and mute.
    - Increased range at which Countermeasures can distract incoming missiles, and how long Wasp Cruise Disruptor missiles can fly for before self-destructing.
    - Buffs to PPCs and Lasers, including fleet versions, to make them more effective and easier to use.
    - Nerf to the AC/L's damage output, it was overperforming.
    - Complete rework of the NAC/L; its slow-firing, huge damage behaviour was transferred to a new Fleet Medium Ballistic, the NAC/H, while the NAC/L is now a faster firing but lighter gun instead that provides high damage at closer ranges.
    - Ballistic PD Turrets can now be bought on Pueblo.
    - Tweaks to how Fleet LRMs and SRMs work. LRMs fire in a fixed high-arc from the launcher now, like arcing artillery. They both fire more missiles now, too.
    - Fleet PPC now fires two projectiles instead of one, making it twice as powerful.
    - New fleet-sized weapon, the Fleet Quad Autocannon, a Small Turret Ballistic gun that provides high damage at close range, perfect for enhancing your anti-fighter power on the Rhino.
    - Area of effect increased for UGBs and Rocket Pods; they'll do splash damage in a wider range now.
    - Reduced density of those little annoying micro-rocks in Colorado's asteroid fields. They threw your aim off a lot and were generally irritating at their previous density.
    - Attempted to spread out the player formation in MP so players don't bang into each other on autopilot when formed up, unsure if the fix targeted the right formation, testing needed please!
    - Fixed multibarrel weapons using the wrong amount of ammo.
    - Fixed multiple crashes.
    - Many general improvements.
    - Known Issue: Objects that 'move around' on server restart do not currently have infocards.
    - Known Issue: Some objects that 'move around' on restart or objects that are created in space when interacting with a terminal do not properly display their name infocard.
    - Known Issue: Fire sounds play inconsistently when multiple multibarrel weapons are fired at once.
    - Client instability when using tradelanes in singleplayer mode.
