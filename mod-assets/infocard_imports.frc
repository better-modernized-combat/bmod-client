Equipping this weapon on smaller ships often requires hard modifications to the power grid, and incautious or inexperienced engineers risk frying ship systems if they don't follow the Ageira-provided installation instructions.\n

Because of its strength and survivability in open combat as well as its stealthy, maneuverable handling, this ship distinguishes itself as the best friend of the modern Bounty Hunter. This, coupled with the tricked-out power array, makes it an easy choice.

H 468519

	\m\bZP-1000M Zero Pointer Targeting Module\B
	\l
	Zero Pointers are not weapons, but special tools used to adjust the amount of lead your targeting crosshair displays by adding them to a weapon group with your other guns. This model simulates a weapon with a projectile speed of 1000m, and will add a significant amount of lead to your weapon group.
	
	When factors like aging targeting software or ionic interference reduce the accuracy of a pilot's lead indicator, it's necessary to adjust the aim point, or zeroing, of the ship's computer manually.  Unfortunately, clunky interfaces and a loss of knowledge in how to adjust certain hardcoded systems means many pilots were unable to perform this important function without significant downtime.
	
	Zero Pointers are a simple but effective solution. Sold as an aftermarket modification, they are cheap and easy to install 'ghost' weapons that fool the ship's computer into thinking they're another gun, usually slower than the others already installed. By adding these slower fake weapons into the same weapon group, they bring down the average that the targeting computer uses to compute a unified aim point for all the grouped weapons, resulting in more lead on the target when added to a group of faster weapons or less lead if added to a group of slower weapons.
	
	Using a Zero Pointer is easy. Just install it, then add it to any weapon group to modify that group's lead pip as desired, and toggle the weapon off when the leading modification is no longer desired. If your shots always seem to be too slow to catch the target, proper use of a Zero Pointer or multiple in combination can improve your accuracy tremendously.
	
	Thanks to the tool's spreading popularity amongst pilots, most ships now have special Class 10 hardpoints that allow their installation without giving up space for any real weapons.\n

	Previously home to a large contingent of Junkers, the North Dallas Debris Field has seen very little rogue activity in the wake of the Houston Catastrophe. The gravitational waves from the event shifted the debris field quite dramatically towards the New York Jump Gate, so the area has seen a substantial increase in Liberty Navy activity and is largely shunned by outlaws.

	By the third quarter of 801 AS the Rheinland-Liberty conflict had reached a critical point. After months of effort, the Rheinland Navy took a series of key locations in Hudson, securing important logistics routes and giving them a solid platform from which to launch a large-scale invasion of Liberty space. Alarmed by consistent Rheinland victories in the Independent Worlds, the Liberty Navy deployed the bulk of its fleet to Texas, hoping to prevent the RNC from making further progress into Liberty space. Undeterred, Rheinland capital ships arrived in the system two weeks later.
	
	Shortly after their arrival, the RNC swept across Texas, securing the southern half of the system and pushing into the orbit of Houston. The Liberty Navy responded in kind, deploying five dreadnoughts, many cruisers and countless fighters to meet the invading force. After several hours of intense fighting, it appeared the Rheinland Navy were close to victory, having completely eliminated the bulk of Liberty's cruiser complement and severely damaged three of the five defending battleships.

	The exact cause of what occurred next isn't entirely clear. Official Liberty sources claim that Rheinland deployed an untested experimental weapon, but given their tactical and strategic situation at the time it seems unlikely that they had any reason to do so. Anyone caught spreading rumours that conflict with the official narrative are investigated and charged with sedition by the LSF.
	
	The resulting blast sent out massive gravitational waves that overloaded the Texas Jump Gates, propagating through the network and burning out the most of Liberty's functional gates. Many jump holes were also destabilized by this massive cataclysm. As for Houston, the incredible fluctuations in gravity have torn the crust off the planet in massive chunks, ejecting unprecedented amounts of rock and cooling lava into orbit and scarring the surface permanently. Both orbiting fleets were obliterated almost instantly, putting a swift end to the conflict.
	
	The surface of Houston is now a molten hellscape. The atmosphere has been stripped away and the planet itself gives off a nightmarish red glow as it cools. While the Liberty government has begun investigating the possibility of mining the exposed core of the planet, any prospects of recovery or terraforming the planet back to what it once was are impossible.

	Where there's junk, there are the Junkers. They've been around since the earliest days of the Trade Lanes. Descended from the working classes, they developed within the House systems as a sort of necessary evil, handling the dirty work that no one else would. They do well salvaging valuable materials from the ever-increasing debris fields throughout Sirius, with the notable exception of Kusari. To this day they remain held at bay by the Hogosha.

	The Junkers make their official money from salvaging debris within the fields, but also have a good deal going with various criminals, who like their \x201cno questions asked\x201d policy. Tolerated by the governments, Junkers sometimes deal in contraband, but they are extremely hard to catch red-handed. They are frequently patronized by the criminal element for the refuge they offer within the often hostile territory of House capital systems.

	Ever since the Houston Catastrophe, the Junkers have been shifting more and more of their Liberty operations out of New York and into Beaumont, which has seen a relocation of the station into the orbit of Planet Chisos and significant storage and defensive expansion over the last few months.

S 478518 Navy Confirms Leaked Footage of RNF Scouts

S 478519 MISSISSIPPI - A Navy intelligence spokesperson has confirmed that documents leaked on the neural net last week \x201cappear to contain sensitive and highly classified material\x201d, but the defence department has skirted categorical claims over the authenticity of the documents while repeatedly stressing that at least some have been doctored. Several of the documents appear to confirm sightings of what appear to be ships belonging to the Rheinland Naval Forces in Texas. The system has been off-limits to the public since the Houston catastrophe last year.

S 478520 New Digital Identity Scheme Announced

S 478521 MANHATTAN - President Bill Baldwin today announced the introduction of a revolutionary new digital identity scheme aimed at stopping crime in its tracks across Liberty. In a rare statement, Baldwin praised the scheme and laid out a timeline for its implementation across the sector. Political opponents of the scheme have described it as \x201cunacceptable\x201d, citing concerns about the disenfranchisement of citizens living in unregistered stations and the previous use of existing ID schemes in citizen bounty programs.

S 478522 General Gate Travel to Resume

S 478523 DENVER - In an interview on Monday the governor of Denver Sean Byrne announced that jump gate travel between Colorado and the rest of Liberty would resume soon. Gate travel has been unavailable to the general public since the beginning of last year, when events in Texas took the gate network offline. Efforts by Deep Space Engineering saw the New York gate bought back online quite quickly, but access has been restricted for non-essential travel.

S 478524 Union Leader Issues Strike Threat

S 478525 AURORA - A union leader has said the station could face a general strike this year as workers voted for fresh action to intensify a recent period of industrial unrest. In a statement, the Denver Workers Union described conditions on the station as \x201cfrankly unacceptable\x201d and described production and scrapping targets set by the station authorities as \x201cunrealistic\x201d. The LSF have confirmed that they will act to prevent any serious disruption of production onboard the station.

S 478526 Squatters Appeal to Government

S 478527 DENVER - A coalition of impoverished Colorado residents made an appeal to the Liberty government today, presenting a message entitled: \x201cBeing poor is not illegal.\x201d The prepared statement was addressed to the legislature in Manhattan and summarised a list of the grievances that many longtime Colorado residents held. They cited numerous examples of revised zoning laws that forced them to abandon their homes for temporary encampments scattered in the hills. There they faced harassment by LPI \x201csquatter\x201d patrols. There's been no official acknowledgement from New York.

S 478528 Budget Boost for Local Forces

S 478529 RIO GRANDE - Good news for Navy pilots in Colorado: Local headquarters have announced that next year's budget for patrols and general equipment will be almost doubled! The announcement comes after calls from Manhattan for the Navy to eliminate the Xenos threat in Colorado once and for all. Manpower and equipment stock in the system have been stretched thin and this announcement is welcome news for the regular patrols here that try their best to keep us all safe.

S 478530 Multiple Navy Patrols Missing

S 478531 RIO GRANDE - According to insider sources, multiple Navy patrol wings have gone missing during routine excursions into Alamosa and Copperton. Senior Bounty Hunter Greg Alvarez has given an unofficial statement that offers an explanation. Apparently, one of the Navy patrol routes, drawn up by pencil pushers on Manhattan and heavily protested by the lieutenants leading the recently downsized patrol wings, leads the patrol not only through Alamosa and Copperton, which are already hotly contested areas, but also through the debris field near the derelict Kepler gate. There, according to Alvarez, infrequent encounters with ace pilots, occasionally accompanied by one or two elites being tutored by said aces, have lead to the losses of multiple entire wings, with no survivors or wrecks to show for it. Navy officials have thus far refused to offer public comment on the matter.

S 478532 LSF Handover to Happen Soon

S 478533 MISSOURI - Navy forces have confirmed they will be taking a step back from problems caused by Liberty Rogue activity in New York, leaving the Liberty Security Force and LPI to deal with piracy in the system. The Navy has had to divert more and more forces to Colorado, Texas and California in recent months to deal with outside threats. An insider at the LPI has described shareholders as \x201cdelighted\x201d with the announcement.

S 478534 Jumpgate Readings Prompt Alarm

S 478535 DENVER - Colorado-based scientists this morning have expressed concern at unusual p-wave readings detected around the Colorado to New York Jumpgate. All three gates in Colorado were disabled during the Houston catastrophe, with the Kepler gate breaking up completely in the aftermath. However, there has been hope in the last few months that the New York gate would be opened for general use in the near future. The authorities have declined to comment on these newest observations around the gate.

S 478536 Alcatraz Delayed Again

S 478537 TAMMS - Overworked prison staff and cramped prisoners will have to wait even longer before space is available on the newly constructed LPI Alcatraz in orbit around Durango. In a statement made yesterday, Liberty Police Incorporated have expressed their apologies that the opening of the orbital prison would have to be put back another 6 months, citing a lack of available manpower to finalise the station. Construction on LPI Alcatraz began last year after both the LPI Huntsville and LPI Sugarland were lost during the Houston Catastrophe. It was originally due to be completed 3 months ago.

S 478538 Union Leader Issues Strike Threat

S 478539 AURORA - Workers are finally taking a stand on the Aurora Salvage Yards! Following brutal treatment by their Navy taskmasters, it seems that the station unions have finally had enough and are thinking about general strike action. Of course the LPI have said they'll escalate the situation, so we'll make sure we're ready to do whatever's necessary to prevent the replacement of hard-working and honest Liberty citizens.

S 478540 New Manifesto Published

S 478541 OURAY - Jean Jefferson released his new 35,000 word manifesto this week to great acclaim aboard the station. The essay, titled \x201cCitizenship is Sacrifice\x201d, lays out how the authoritarian regime of Liberty is secretly bringing foreign labour into the sector in order to replace honest and hard working citizens who are much more resistant to oppression than their counterparts. The manifesto even addresses the so-called free thinkers who don't believe it's even possible for foreigners to access the sector after Houston by revealing a secret series of jump holes in California that the Navy have been using for decades for human trafficking.

S 478542 Cutting-Edge Gear Goes Commercial

S 478543 PUEBLO - The first batch of Ageira's brand new solid state 'SEQ' laser cannons came off the production line at Pueblo and onto the open market this week.

	\m\bPILOT: XENOS ACE\B
	\l
	An ace pilot, who survived the disintegration of their ship. This pilot is a member of the Xenos, and their comrades will pay a handsome reward for the safe return of this valuable expert to a friendly base. The Liberty Police will also pay a commission if they're delivered to the nearest prison to be interred as a new worker, but they'll pay the same for them as any other prisoner, uninterested in the additional skill this pilot might have. The Liberty Navy may pay more at the nearest military base to interrogate this elite enemy instead.
	\l
	Miners and labourers who took up arms for their xenophobic ideals, Xenos pilots attack foreign shipping as well as the jumpgates that allow other nations to come to Liberty space, battling them and the government in a war of underfunded insurrection. Xenos supporters accuse foreign companies and workers of stealing their jobs and their livelihoods; to a Xenos, anyone who aids or supports external trade is just as much their enemy as the foreigners they so deeply despise.
	\l
	With several dozen successful missions under their belt, ace pilots are household names and have enough fighter takedowns that both the Navy and the Xenos have actively kept track. Ace pilots are a force of nature, moving like lightning and striking like the thunderclap. It is highly recommended to engage them only with a significant advantage in numbers and firepower or else avoid them at all costs. Those who emerge victorious in a fight against one of these famous pilots, particularly by themselves, never emerge unchanged from the experience, and may rightly call themselves aces in turn.
	\l
	Aces are known to be proud individuals, who rarely pursue a beaten opponent, but who will even more rarely back down from a fight themselves. Despite generally fighting on their own or in wings of two, they often pick whatever fight they are given, and then fight on until the bitter end, with most of their number refusing to eject on principle. Having captured such a uniquely skilled and knowledgeable individual presents you with an opportunity to reap a massive reward from the Navy. 

H 483521
	\m\bPILOT: XENOS ELITE\B
	\l
	An elite pilot, who ejected out in the last moment before their ship was destroyed. This pilot is a member of the Xenos, and their comrades will pay a handsome reward for the safe return of this valuable expert to a friendly base. The Liberty Police will also pay a commission if they're delivered to the nearest prison to be interred as a new worker, but they'll pay the same for them as any other prisoner, uninterested in the additional skill this pilot might have.

Xenos supporters accuse foreign companies and workers of stealing their jobs and their livelihoods; to a Xenos, anyone who aids or supports external trade is just as much their enemy as the foreigners they so deeply despise.
	\l
	Elite Xenos are the top combatants of their spaceborne operations, with at least a dozen successful raids and freighter interdictions to their names. As the most experienced and well-equipped pilots in their whole organisation, they pose a serious threat even to seasoned fighter pilots, and Navy wings are instructed to double up on them before they can score more kills to etch onto their well-marked hulls.

H 483522
	\m\bPILOT: XENOS ROOKIE\B
	\l
	A rookie pilot, ejected from their ship. This pilot is a member of the Xenos, and their comrades will pay a small reward for their recruit's safe return to a friendly base, as will the Liberty Police if they're delivered to the nearest prison to be interred as a new worker in their correctional factories.
	\l
	Miners and labourers who took up arms for their xenophobic ideals, Xenos pilots attack foreign shipping as well as the jumpgates that allow other nations to come to Liberty space, battling them and the government in a war of underfunded insurrection. Xenos supporters accuse foreign companies and workers of stealing their jobs and their livelihoods; to a Xenos, anyone who aids or supports external trade is just as much their enemy as the foreigners they so deeply despise.
	\l
	Rookie Xenos have usually never touched the controls of a fighter until their first week of sorties. A lack of proper simulators or training means that like their lives of hard labour beforehand, most must learn their skills through experience on the job. Survival rates for Xenos rookies are horrifically low as a result, with more than half of them being killed within their first three operations.

H 483523
	\m\bPILOT: XENOS VETERAN\B
	\l
	A veteran pilot, who managed to eject from their ship before destruction. This pilot is a member of the Xenos, and their comrades will pay a reward for their safe return to a friendly base. So will the Liberty Police if they're delivered to the nearest prison factory to be held there as a new worker, though their disinterest in the exploits of the person delivered means they'll buy them for the same price as a fresh-faced recruit.
	\l
	Miners and labourers who took up arms for their xenophobic ideals, Xenos pilots attack foreign shipping as well as the jumpgates that allow other nations to come to Liberty space, battling them and the government in a war of underfunded insurrection. Xenos supporters accuse foreign companies and workers of stealing their jobs and their livelihoods; to a Xenos, anyone who aids or supports external trade is just as much their enemy as the foreigners they so deeply despise.
	\l
	Veteran Xenos have survived the deadly gauntlet of their first few missions, usually against vulnerable freighters and the escort fighters who defend them. Some have even tangled with the Liberty Navy and survived, though the better training and equipment of their government enemies means few of them have scored kills against experienced military pilots.

H 484520
	It's been difficult here. Most of the folks in this bar have been stuck in-system for months and are pretty sick of it. Denver's been okay as we mostly produce the consumer goods and food we use, but I've been really missing my favourite blend of coffee. The synthetic stuff they pump out of the labs here is just awful.

H 484521
	I still can't quite believe that Houston is gone. A whole planet, just like that! I know there was a war on, and everyone thought they knew what might happen, but it never went as far as that. We heard about it a month or so after it happened. It was a bit too big for the LSF to keep quiet for any real amount of time.

H 484522
	Most of the stations in Colorado have opened up their automated production facilities to independent pilots again. Everything shut down when the gates went offline. Allowing independents to fabricate their own gear should put a stick in the eye of the Aurora Unions, and make the authorities some money on the side too.

H 484523
	All the Alloys from Tamms, Alcatraz and Pueblo ship to Denver. Tamms is part of the reason the Aurora Unions are so unhappy. The output from Xenos prison labour there has increased the supply for basic alloys pretty significantly, so the bosses up on the orbital rig refused to give the shipbreakers a pay-rise. I reckon it's going to all get pretty ugly soon. 

H 484524
	My brother works as a shipbreaker up on the Aurora rig and says the conditions up there are terrible! The sort of awful things we used to hear about happening in Leeds, right on our doorstep. What is Liberty coming to?

H 484525
	Hey, if you were thinking about upgrading your ship's gear, maybe don't buy it directly from the dealer? Usually if you can scrap together the resources and you're on good terms with the authorities you can get a better deal fabricating your own stuff.

H 484526
	I heard whatever took the gates offline destabilised all the jump holes out of the system too. The Xenos have been pretty agitated lately, I don't think they've been able to get supplies reliably on their usual routes.

H 484527
	What are the Xenos even still doing in this system? They got what they wanted with the gates down: no more foreign traffic in Liberty. I can't imagine the Navy will be keen to reopen any of the external gates anytime soon after what happened in Texas.

H 484528
	I'm on shore leave from the Rio Grande. We do a regular patrol along the trade lane from here up to Pueblo and I think it's fairly safe now. We have a pretty good route to stop the Xenos getting into Silverton and disrupting the trade lanes there. The supply run escort to the Galileo gate though? That's another matter.

H 484529
	We have a limited agreement with the Navy and Ageira to ship in pharmaceuticals via the New York gate once a day. It's still only partially operational, but nowhere in this system produces them so it's essential that we can keep a supply route open until normal trade can resume.

H 484530
	I've been stuck here since the gates went offline. Kusari didn't have the best of relations with Liberty, but at least there was trade. I've been thinking of trying to settle here. Even if they do get the route to Shikoku through the Independent Worlds established again, it might be years, and I may not even have a home to go back to.

H 484531
	We don't have full authorization to work openly in this system again yet. It's ridiculous they've authorised Freelancers but not the guild. We helped keep this system together when they were bringing in the Tamms.

H 484532
	If you're heading out to hunt Xenos, give the Cheyenne field a go. Usually you can find them alone or in pairs there and pick them off before their friends arrive. I think a lot of the less experienced pilots spend time there trying to scrape together resources for repairs as it's off the main Navy patrol routes.

H 484533
	I'm glad things have stabilised here. We had 5 months of panic when the gates shut off.You wouldn't believe it now but they were talking about rationing before Ageira got the New York gate working again.

H 484534
	I heard the Navy lost a whole patrol out near the Kepler gate last week, 4 fighters, just gone! They've adjusted the regular route out that way to keep clear of the debris field, but none of them will talk about what's going on there.

H 484535
	It was touch and go for the Rio Grande for a bit. They were on their last few barrels of MOX when the New York gate came back online. Losing the Rio would have been disastrous for Denver, it projects a huge amount of force and keeps the Xenos contained in the Alamosa and Copperton fields.

H 484546
	It's good to see miners in Silverton again. I know it's desperation on the part of the authorities but it takes me back to when Denver was just being settled and Colorado was the place to be for someone seeking their fortune.

H 484547
	With the LSF taking over New York's security entirely, we should have more resources to mop up what's left of the Xenos here soon.It's just been the Rio Grande and a handful of patrol frigates the last few months.

H 484548
	The LSF takeover has been a long time coming. Private interests on Manhattan have been trying to convince the administration that the system was 'safe' for decades. They didn't let up even when the war kicked off. Now the excuse is that the Navy's needed elsewhere. I don't buy it, we're not spread that thin!

H 484549
	Even though the LSF have said they'll handle any union action on Aurora we'll probably be asked to step in. The whole thing stinks of Xenos, which gives the administration the perfect excuse to get the Navy involved if anything kicks off in the Orbital Security Zone.

H 484550
	My CO's patrol went missing out by the Kepler debris field last week. The debris out there is too dense for a patrol frigate, and it's a long way for a fighter to fly without support. There's talk of shifting the patrol routes away from the field and just leaving it to the Xenos.

H 484551
	Colorado's not the worst place to be stuck. When the gates went down I had a friend who was posted to Los Angeles. They can't grow their own food in-system there so things got grim pretty quickly when the gates went offline. I don't know how things are going there now though, the news service has gone quiet and I've not heard from my friend for a few months.

H 484552
	We know the Xenos have a base in the Copperton Field. The Navy pushed them out of Silverton and smashed their base just before the war kicked off. They got too much time to entrench while we were off keeping the Rheinlanders at bay and now there's no way we could bring a patrol frigate or a cruiser to bear there and deal with them.

H 484553
	Even if the Navy could push the Xenos out of the system, there's no way they'd be rid of them completely. We're pretty sure they've got out-of-system bases, and they're brave or stupid enough to keep using jump holes we won't follow them into after Houston. No idea how they're getting supplies out that far.

H 484554
	We've not seen too much of the Rogues or Outcasts since the gates went down. The jump holes out the system are very unstable, but you can get through if you're lucky. I guess there isn't much here for them anymore, especially with the Xenos swelling their ranks from the unions on Denver.

H 484555
	We're here to have a chat with the Captain of the Rio and see if he'll give some of us permission to hunt in the Alamosa field. We've got authorization from the LPI around Tamms, but the Navy's been playing hard to get with patrol authorization this close to Denver.

H 484556
	After our base in the Silverton field got smashed we retreated here. Lucky for us Liberty decided to start a war. We've had over a year to prepare for the Navy's push against us now. We'll be ready.

H 484557
	The Navy and the Bounty Hunter's Guild don't dare follow us through the jump holes now. Whatever happened to the gates did something to them and now the stupid warnings Ageira puts out about them might actually have some merit. It's given us a space we can stage from free of Navy interference.

H 484558
	We don't get our supplies here directly from Denver very often. Our usual man comes in from New York, usually when we least expect him. The Navy don't seem to have the manpower to keep the Silverton Field well-patrolled, so we've got a good lifeline here for now.

H 484559
	There's always demand for small arms here. Even though we all share a common cause here, arguments are common. Usually whoever has the biggest gun comes off better.

H 484560
	They keep the bar nice for visitors, but the air on this station is rank. We have to bring in oxygen from elsewhere, so the recyclers on the decks below us are working at full capacity 24/7. It wouldn't be such a problem if we could get the parts to fix it, but we're running pretty old models here and sourcing them is hard, especially after the war.

H 484561
	Ageira's locked the navigation computers for most ships now so they can't use jump holes, but we've got a guy down on deck 7 who's figured out a way to get around it. We've lost a few guys going through them since Houston, but it's let us run rings around the Navy and the hunters.

H 484562
	Man I hate those patrol frigates. They've only got a few of them in-system at the moment, but they stop us really spending any time at all in open space. If they came into the field we'd make short work of them with our Trapdoor platforms, but they've been smart enough to just stay at the edges so far.

H 484563
	When the Xenos began, we were just miners who kept getting shafted by Liberty. There were fewer and fewer jobs as the years rolled by. Finally, there was nothing left for us, no jobs, not unless you could use a data pad instead of an auto-digger. All our jobs were being done by somebody in Rheinland or Kusari. Well, we decided to take back what had been taken from us

H 484564
	I heard they're working on a machine to temporarily stabilise jump holes up on level 8. The Navy have had a terrible time stamping out the Xenos in this system as they've been unwilling to use jump holes since the Houston Catastrophe.

H 484565
	Have you seen the new D-20 autocannons yet? They cut through unshielded ship panels like a hot knife through butter. R&D really took their time with this one, tons of improvements over the old D-18s they were running in the Texas conflict.

H 484566
	The technology stack for the nanite bursters is really odd. Most of it is proprietary and locked down, but what I have been able to get my hands on is unlike anything I've ever seen. The physics of it don't make sense. It seems decades ahead of what we have now, I have no idea how R&D cooked it up.

H 484567
	When the gates shut down, Ageira and DSE had to put their rivalries aside and team up to get everything running again. We pretty much run this station together now, although DSE keeps to their material science stuff and we stick to all the interesting problems.

H 484568
	I heard the teams over at the New York gate found something odd when they were repairing the link. There were rumours going around about a message on the subspace link-line, but management shut that down pretty quickly.

H 484569
	It took us months to get the gate back online after Houston. No-one had a clue what was going on and just diagnosing what was wrong was nearly impossible. On top of that we were contending with the damage done when the Kepler gate shattered. I heard a few convoys were out that way at the time and were unfortunate enough to get themselves caught in the blast radius. We got lucky here.

H 484570
	The new Lasers Ageira's pushed out are fantastic, like the energy weapons in old sci-fi shows we used to watch as kids. If we'd had these during the Texas conflict we would have pushed Rheinland right back into Hamburg in no time at all.

H 484571
	I got stuck out here when the gates went down like so many others. I had an authorised trade route from Leeds and should have been back months ago. I'm hoping they open the gates soon, but communications have been pretty locked down. I've not heard any word from headquarters, so I don't know if they even know I'm still alive.

H 484572
	This Liner was commissioned in a hurry and you can tell. The doors jam, the security systems don't work properly and the environmental systems have a minor failure every other week. It's a disaster waiting to happen.

H 484573
	The Xenos regularly attempt raids against Alcatraz, hoping to delay the completion of the station. Half the time when they're firing it's their own people stuck outside in vac-suits they're toasting. I can't tell if they're cold or just stupid. Maybe both.

H 484574
	Alcatraz looks pretty complete from the outside, but don't let that fool you, half the prison labour that should be building it ends up working production lines on this liner for the LPI. Half the alloys in Colorado must come through this place.

H 484575
	It's mostly Xenos in here now, but they've started bringing in petty criminals from Denver lately to make up for shortages. Those folks shouldn't be anywhere near a station like this, but I guess they're pretty keen to make sure Alcatraz gets done in time.

H 484576
	When it all kicks off over on Aurora, this place is going to fill up fast. We're understaffed as it is, I don't know how we'll cope with a sudden boom in the prison population here.

H 484577
	There's an escape attempt maybe every other week here. Last poor bastard got into the airlock and then ended up spacing himself when he saw his buddies outside get toasted by the static defences. Gotta say if I got stuck here I'd consider doing the same, there's no way out for a lot of them.

H 484578
	The loss of Texas was a huge blow to Liberty's labour force. So much alloy and hull panel manufacturing got blown away with Houston it's a wonder there's any ships left in space. I think the LPI wants to corner the market with Alcatraz here, a but like they did with Texas.

H 484579
	The LPI are pretty short-staffed, so a lot of guild members have been contracted out for security here. They pay on-station guard work pretty well, but I'd much rather be in space than on this old piece of junk.
