	\l
	Long Range Missiles or "LRMs" accelerate fast and can track targets at long distances. Their lack of agility makes them easier to dodge in a dogfight, but their increased effectiveness against shields compared to SRMs means they can be used to initiate an attack rather than only follow up on one.
	
	This launcher fits in the Medium Missile slot and has an average cooldown between shots. It's useful for putting out a steady number of LRMs throughout a fight, allowing users to support a battle from afar or deal good damage to large targets unable to effectively evade them.\n

	\m\bCTE-1500 "Hawk" Civilian Light Fighter\B
	\l
	Like an enormous bird of prey, the Hawk can sublimely snatch its targets out of the sky with tremendous grace.Its unmistakable shape casts a shadow of fear on its enemies, while the advanced power and armor ratingsensure that it can deliver the harshest of attacks or repel those foolish enough to challenge it.

H 468511
	\m\bCTE-3000 "Falcon" Civilian Heavy Fighter\B
	\l
	As the name attests, this ship is formidable and is well-deserving of the reputation that it enjoys. With abalanced combination of refined offensive and defensive technologies, the Falcon delivers an astonishingamount of potential firepower to potential adversaries quickly and efficiently.

H 468512
	\m\bCTE-6000 "Eagle" Civilian Very Heavy Fighter\B
	\l
	The Eagle stands vigil over the economic interests and, therefore, the ideological interests of Liberty. Withits maxed-out power rating and reinforced armor plating, it is the most sophisticated and advanced vessel inthe Civilian class. All in all, it delivers the maximum defensive potential and punishing offensive firepowerthat credits can buy.

H 468513
	\m\bLZF-6364 "Patriot" Liberty Light Fighter\B
	\l
	With comparable models in active government and military service, the Patriot delivers state-of-the-art	maneuverability and punishing firepower in one unbeatable package. Impressive extensibility and a generous cargo hold round out the top-notch appointments.

H 468514
	\m\bBDR-337 "Defender" Liberty Heavy Fighter\B
	\l
	The best of the best, this heavily outfitted rig represents the pinnacle of Liberty's technological advances and design savoir faire. With its elevated armor and power rating as standard and the additional mount for	firepower, its no wonder that this ship is the number one choice of the Liberty Armed Forces.

H 468515
	\b\mBDR-496 "Guardian" Liberty Very Heavy Fighter
	\B\l
	A collection of the most cutting-edge fighter technology Liberty has to offer, the Guardian is a serious effort by the Liberty Navy to refine and push the Defender chassis as far as possible. Sporting additional armor, an improved power plant and extra mounts, the Guardian is still not approved for civilian sale.

H 468516
	\m\bEL-HiL27 "Rhino" Liberty Freighter\B
	\l
	With the economic foundation of Sirius firmly built on Libertys commercial interests, the Rhino certainly lives up to its name. The vast cargo hold is the hallmark of this impressive beast, surrounded by doubly reinforced structure and protective armor hull. This and the advanced weapon system make the Rhino a force to be reckoned with.

H 468517
	\m\bAP-6364 "Piranha" Bounty Hunter Light Fighter\B
	\l
	With crime on the rise, there has been a resurgence in the Bounty Hunter trade. To hunt down a criminal one must think like a criminal and be armed like one too. The Piranha delivers expertly on this note, providing every bit of the firepower and armor needed for the job. The added cargo space for transport and delivery of captured escape pods rounds out its generous appointments.

H 468518
	\m\bAP-7031 "Barracuda" Bounty Hunter Heavy Fighter\B
	\l
	When the fire is thick and flack and fallout rip the competition apart, the Barracuda still fights. Because of its strength and survivability in open combat as well as its stealthy, maneuverable handling, this ship distinguishes itself as the best friend of the modern Bounty Hunter. This, coupled with the tricked-out power array, makes it an easy choice.

H 468519
	\m\bAP-8050 "Hammerhead" Bounty Hunter Very Heavy Fighter\B
	\l
	Desperate times call for desperate measures, in this case desperate designs. The Hammerhead is the result of years of work by the Bounty Hunters Guild to improve upon the traditional AP line. Its armor and power ratings have been elevated to peak levels to deliver a greater advantage to Bounty Hunters in the field.

H 468520
	\m\b"Paladin" Heavy Fighter\B
	\l

H 468521
	\m\bZ-1138 "Mule" Pirate Freighter\B
	\l
	The lifeline of any organization is its ability to monetize opportunity. In the case of more alternative unions, this fundamental truth is even more vital. Fortunately, the Mule is the solution to the problem of moving a significant supply of goods through hazardous opposition in order to maintain these channels of commerce and opportunity.
	
H 468522
	\m\b"Bullfrog" Combat Service Vehicle\B
	\l
	The remarkably low cost of making and maintaining this ship's design has ensured its widespread use across the sector. Cheap, flexible, and with a cargo hold that's significantly larger than most fighter-sized ships, the CSV can be found in almost every star system in Sirius, supporting the needs of almost every group in the sector.
	
H 468523
	\m\b"Orca" Junkers Very Heavy Fighter\B
	\l
	Ambitions grow, and the tools used for their achievement must grow with them; that's what led to the Orca being designed. An expansion on the Angler (itself a refit of the humble CSV), this somewhat makeshift Very Heavy Fighter provides the muscle and power needed to take on larger scores. While its hull and powerplant are a little weaker than standard for its size, it makes up for it with a bigger cargo bay, and flexible hardpoints that allows the user to choose between doubling up on powerful missiles or ballistics, or bringing a more standard, balanced loadout.

	\m\bZP-1000M Zero Pointer Targeting Module\B
	\l
	Zero Pointers are not weapons, but special tools used to adjust the amount of lead your targeting crosshair displays by adding them to a weapon group with your other guns. This model simulates a weapon with a projectile speed of 1000m, and will add a significant amount of lead to your weapon group.
	
	When factors like aging targeting software or ionic interference reduce the accuracy of a pilot's lead indicator, it's necessary to adjust the aim point, or zeroing, of the ship's computer manually.  Unfortunately, clunky interfaces and a loss of knowledge in how to adjust certain hardcoded systems means many pilots were unable to perform this important function without significant downtime.
	
	Zero Pointers are a simple but effective solution. Sold as an aftermarket modification, they are cheap and easy to install 'ghost' weapons that fool the ship's computer into thinking they're another gun, usually slower than the others already installed. By adding these slower fake weapons into the same weapon group, they bring down the average that the targeting computer uses to compute a unified aim point for all the grouped weapons, resulting in more lead on the target when added to a group of faster weapons or less lead if added to a group of slower weapons.
	
	Using a Zero Pointer is easy. Just install it, then add it to any weapon group to modify that group's lead pip as desired, and toggle the weapon off when the leading modification is no longer desired. If your shots always seem to be too slow to catch the target, proper use of a Zero Pointer or multiple in combination can improve your accuracy tremendously.
	
	Thanks to the tool's spreading popularity amongst pilots, most ships now have special Class 10 hardpoints that allow their installation without giving up space for any real weapons.\n

	Previously home to a large contingent of Junkers, the North Dallas Debris Field has seen very little rogue activity in the wake of the Houston Catastrophe. The gravitational waves from the event shifted the debris field quite dramatically towards the New York Jump Gate, so the area has seen a substantial increase in Liberty Navy activity and is largely shunned by outlaws.

	A pocket of debris housing the remains of LPI \iSugarland\I. The Prison station was captured during Rheinland's initial invasion of the system, then subsequently abandoned in the wake of the Houston Catastrophe. The field is gradually falling into the gravity well of Brazos, and Junkers can often be found in the field searching for anything of value before it's gone forever.

	The South Dallas Debris Field consists of remnants of the Dallas Research complex, destroyed in the Texas incident in 500 AS, as well as parts of the LPI \iSugarland\I complex and what's left of the Hudson Gate.
	
	Despite the lack of an operational Jump Gate, Rheinland scouts have occasionally been sighted patrolling the field, suggesting the presence of a stable jump hole somewhere nearby.

	In the immediate aftermath of the Houston Catastrophe, the incredible force of the gravitational waves rippling through the Texas system collapsed the dark matter clouds of the Grande Negra and Pequena Negra into a single large formation now known as the Maw.
	
	Fed by a seething singularity at it's heart, the cloud's dark exterior hides some of the most dangerous dangerous natural phenomena in Sirius, from powerful, constantly shifting gravity fields to intense radiation and - as some rumors say - hallucinations and other monsters of the mind.

	By the third quarter of 801 AS the Rheinland-Liberty conflict had reached a critical point. After months of effort, the Rheinland Navy took a series of key locations in Hudson, securing important logistics routes and giving them a solid platform from which to launch a large-scale invasion of Liberty space. Alarmed by consistent Rheinland victories in the Independent Worlds, the Liberty Navy deployed the bulk of its fleet to Texas, hoping to prevent the RNC from making further progress into Liberty space. Undeterred, Rheinland capital ships arrived in the system two weeks later.
	
	Shortly after their arrival, the RNC swept across Texas, securing the southern half of the system and pushing into the orbit of Houston. The Liberty Navy responded in kind, deploying five dreadnoughts, many cruisers and countless fighters to meet the invading force. After several hours of intense fighting, it appeared the Rheinland Navy were close to victory, having completely eliminated the bulk of Liberty's cruiser complement and severely damaged three of the five defending battleships.

	The exact cause of what occurred next isn't entirely clear. Official Liberty sources claim that Rheinland deployed an untested experimental weapon, but given their tactical and strategic situation at the time it seems unlikely that they had any reason to do so. Anyone caught spreading rumours that conflict with the official narrative are investigated and charged with sedition by the LSF.
	
	The resulting blast sent out massive gravitational waves that overloaded the Texas Jump Gates, propagating through the network and burning out the most of Liberty's functional gates. Many jump holes were also destabilized by this massive cataclysm. As for Houston, the incredible fluctuations in gravity have torn the crust off the planet in massive chunks, ejecting unprecedented amounts of rock and cooling lava into orbit and scarring the surface permanently. Both orbiting fleets were obliterated almost instantly, putting a swift end to the conflict.
	
	The surface of Houston is now a molten hellscape. The atmosphere has been stripped away and the planet itself gives off a nightmarish red glow as it cools. While the Liberty government has begun investigating the possibility of mining the exposed core of the planet, any prospects of recovery or terraforming the planet back to what it once was are impossible.

	Where there's junk, there are the Junkers. They've been around since the earliest days of the Trade Lanes. Descended from the working classes, they developed within the House systems as a sort of necessary evil, handling the dirty work that no one else would. They do well salvaging valuable materials from the ever-increasing debris fields throughout Sirius, with the notable exception of Kusari. To this day they remain held at bay by the Hogosha.

	The Junkers make their official money from salvaging debris within the fields, but also have a good deal going with various criminals, who like their \x201cno questions asked\x201d policy. Tolerated by the governments, Junkers sometimes deal in contraband, but they are extremely hard to catch red-handed. They are frequently patronized by the criminal element for the refuge they offer within the often hostile territory of House capital systems.

	Ever since the Houston Catastrophe, the Junkers have been shifting more and more of their Liberty operations out of New York and into Beaumont, which has seen a relocation of the station into the orbit of Planet Chisos and significant storage and defensive expansion over the last few months.

With the declining long-term water situation in the California System, however, the wealthy elite of Los Angeles began to look elsewhere for a vacation spot and found Denver's rough, beautiful vistas to be ideal. Emigration from Los Angeles and Manhattan injected new life into the Denver economy, reviving the planet even as the new upper-class assumed control of the local government.

Manpower and equipment stock in the system have been stretched thin and this announcement is welcome news for the regular patrols here that try their best to keep us all safe.

S 478530 Multiple Navy Patrols Missing

S 478531 RIO GRANDE - According to insider sources, multiple Navy patrol wings have gone missing during routine excursions into Alamosa and Copperton. Senior Bounty Hunter Greg Alvarez has given an unofficial statement that offers an explanation. Apparently, one of the Navy patrol routes, drawn up by pencil pushers on Manhattan and heavily protested by the lieutenants leading the recently downsized patrol wings, leads the patrol not only through Alamosa and Copperton, which are already hotly contested areas, but also through the debris field near the derelict Kepler gate. There, according to Alvarez, infrequent encounters with ace pilots, occasionally accompanied by one or two elites being tutored by said aces, have lead to the losses of multiple entire wings, with no survivors or wrecks to show for it. Navy officials have thus far refused to offer public comment on the matter.

S 478532 LSF Handover to Happen Soon

S 478533 MISSOURI - Navy forces have confirmed they will be taking a step back from problems caused by Liberty Rogue activity in New York, leaving the Liberty Security Force and LPI to deal with piracy in the system. The Navy has had to divert more and more forces to Colorado, Texas and California in recent months to deal with outside threats. An insider at the LPI has described shareholders as \x201cdelighted\x201d with the announcement.

S 478534 Jumpgate Readings Prompt Alarm

S 478535 DENVER - Colorado-based scientists this morning have expressed concern at unusual p-wave readings detected around the Colorado to New York Jumpgate. All three gates in Colorado were disabled during the Houston catastrophe, with the Kepler gate breaking up completely in the aftermath. However, there has been hope in the last few months that the New York gate would be opened for general use in the near future. The authorities have declined to comment on these newest observations around the gate.

S 478536 Alcatraz Delayed Again

S 478537 TAMMS - Overworked prison staff and cramped prisoners will have to wait even longer before space is available on the newly constructed LPI Alcatraz in orbit around Durango. In a statement made yesterday, Liberty Police Incorporated have expressed their apologies that the opening of the orbital prison would have to be put back another 6 months, citing a lack of available manpower to finalise the station. Construction on LPI Alcatraz began last year after both the LPI Huntsville and LPI Sugarland were lost during the Houston Catastrophe. It was originally due to be completed 3 months ago.

S 478538 Union Leader Issues Strike Threat

S 478539 AURORA - Workers are finally taking a stand on the Aurora Salvage Yards! Following brutal treatment by their Navy taskmasters, it seems that the station unions have finally had enough and are thinking about general strike action. Of course the LPI have said they'll escalate the situation, so we'll make sure we're ready to do whatever's necessary to prevent the replacement of hard-working and honest Liberty citizens.

S 478540 New Manifesto Published

S 478541 OURAY - Jean Jefferson released his new 35,000 word manifesto this week to great acclaim aboard the station. The essay, titled \x201cCitizenship is Sacrifice\x201d, lays out how the authoritarian regime of Liberty is secretly bringing foreign labour into the sector in order to replace honest and hard working citizens who are much more resistant to oppression than their counterparts. The manifesto even addresses the so-called free thinkers who don't believe it's even possible for foreigners to access the sector after Houston by revealing a secret series of jump holes in California that the Navy have been using for decades for human trafficking.

S 478542 Cutting-Edge Gear Goes Commercial

S 478543 PUEBLO - The first batch of Ageira's brand new solid state 'SEQ' laser cannons came off the production line at Pueblo and onto the open market this week. In a press-release executives announced that they were delighted to be able to finally release the SEQ range for general purchase, and promised many exciting developments yet to come. Shares in the company have jumped by 8 percent as of this morning.

	\m\bPILOT: XENOS ACE\B
	\l
	An ace pilot, who survived the disintegration of their ship. This pilot is a member of the Xenos, and their comrades will pay a handsome reward for the safe return of this valuable expert to a friendly base. The Liberty Police will also pay a commission if they're delivered to the nearest prison to be interred as a new worker, but they'll pay the same for them as any other prisoner, uninterested in the additional skill this pilot might have. The Liberty Navy may pay more at the nearest military base to interrogate this elite enemy instead.
	\l
	Miners and labourers who took up arms for their xenophobic ideals, Xenos pilots attack foreign shipping as well as the jumpgates that allow other nations to come to Liberty space, battling them and the government in a war of underfunded insurrection. Xenos supporters accuse foreign companies and workers of stealing their jobs and their livelihoods; to a Xenos, anyone who aids or supports external trade is just as much their enemy as the foreigners they so deeply despise.
	\l
	With several dozen successful missions under their belt, ace pilots are household names and have enough fighter takedowns that both the Navy and the Xenos have actively kept track. Ace pilots are a force of nature, moving like lightning and striking like the thunderclap. It is highly recommended to engage them only with a significant advantage in numbers and firepower or else avoid them at all costs. Those who emerge victorious in a fight against one of these famous pilots, particularly by themselves, never emerge unchanged from the experience, and may rightly call themselves aces in turn.
	\l
	Aces are known to be proud individuals, who rarely pursue a beaten opponent, but who will even more rarely back down from a fight themselves. Despite generally fighting on their own or in wings of two, they often pick whatever fight they are given, and then fight on until the bitter end, with most of their number refusing to eject on principle. Having captured such a uniquely skilled and knowledgeable individual presents you with an opportunity to reap a massive reward from the Navy. 

H 483521
	\m\bPILOT: XENOS ELITE\B
	\l
	An elite pilot, who ejected out in the last moment before their ship was destroyed. This pilot is a member of the Xenos, and their comrades will pay a handsome reward for the safe return of this valuable expert to a friendly base. The Liberty Police will also pay a commission if they're delivered to the nearest prison to be interred as a new worker, but they'll pay the same for them as any other prisoner, uninterested in the additional skill this pilot might have.

Xenos supporters accuse foreign companies and workers of stealing their jobs and their livelihoods; to a Xenos, anyone who aids or supports external trade is just as much their enemy as the foreigners they so deeply despise.
	\l
	Elite Xenos are the top combatants of their spaceborne operations, with at least a dozen successful raids and freighter interdictions to their names. As the most experienced and well-equipped pilots in their whole organisation, they pose a serious threat even to seasoned fighter pilots, and Navy wings are instructed to double up on them before they can score more kills to etch onto their well-marked hulls.

H 483522
	\m\bPILOT: XENOS ROOKIE\B
	\l
	A rookie pilot, ejected from their ship. This pilot is a member of the Xenos, and their comrades will pay a small reward for their recruit's safe return to a friendly base, as will the Liberty Police if they're delivered to the nearest prison to be interred as a new worker in their correctional factories.
	\l
	Miners and labourers who took up arms for their xenophobic ideals, Xenos pilots attack foreign shipping as well as the jumpgates that allow other nations to come to Liberty space, battling them and the government in a war of underfunded insurrection. Xenos supporters accuse foreign companies and workers of stealing their jobs and their livelihoods; to a Xenos, anyone who aids or supports external trade is just as much their enemy as the foreigners they so deeply despise.
	\l
	Rookie Xenos have usually never touched the controls of a fighter until their first week of sorties. A lack of proper simulators or training means that like their lives of hard labour beforehand, most must learn their skills through experience on the job. Survival rates for Xenos rookies are horrifically low as a result, with more than half of them being killed within their first three operations.

H 483523
	\m\bPILOT: XENOS VETERAN\B
	\l
	A veteran pilot, who managed to eject from their ship before destruction. This pilot is a member of the Xenos, and their comrades will pay a reward for their safe return to a friendly base. So will the Liberty Police if they're delivered to the nearest prison factory to be held there as a new worker, though their disinterest in the exploits of the person delivered means they'll buy them for the same price as a fresh-faced recruit.

	Miners and labourers who took up arms for their xenophobic ideals, Xenos pilots attack foreign shipping as well as the jumpgates that allow other nations to come to Liberty space, battling them and the government in a war of underfunded insurrection. Xenos supporters accuse foreign companies and workers of stealing their jobs and their livelihoods; to a Xenos, anyone who aids or supports external trade is just as much their enemy as the foreigners they so deeply despise.
	\l
	Veteran Xenos have survived the deadly gauntlet of their first few missions, usually against vulnerable freighters and the escort fighters who defend them. Some have even tangled with the Liberty Navy and survived, though the better training and equipment of their government enemies means few of them have scored kills against experienced military pilots.

H 484520
	It's been difficult here. Most of the folks in this bar have been stuck in-system for months and are pretty sick of it. Denver's been okay as we mostly produce the consumer goods and food we use, but I've been really missing my favourite blend of coffee. The synthetic stuff they pump out of the labs here is just awful.

H 484521
	I still can't quite believe that Houston is gone. A whole planet, just like that! I know there was a war on, and everyone thought they knew what might happen, but it never went as far as that. We heard about it a month or so after it happened. It was a bit too big for the LSF to keep quiet for any real amount of time.

H 484522
	Most of the stations in Colorado have opened up their automated production facilities to independent pilots again. Everything shut down when the gates went offline. Allowing independents to fabricate their own gear should put a stick in the eye of the Aurora Unions, and make the authorities some money on the side too.

H 484523
	All the Alloys from Tamms, Alcatraz and Pueblo ship to Denver. Tamms is part of the reason the Aurora Unions are so unhappy. The output from Xenos prison labour there has increased the supply for basic alloys pretty significantly, so the bosses up on the orbital rig refused to give the shipbreakers a pay-rise. I reckon it's going to all get pretty ugly soon. 

H 484524
	My brother works as a shipbreaker up on the Aurora rig and says the conditions up there are terrible! The sort of awful things we used to hear about happening in Leeds, right on our doorstep. What is Liberty coming to?

H 484525
	Hey, if you were thinking about upgrading your ship's gear, maybe don't buy it directly from the dealer? Usually if you can scrap together the resources and you're on good terms with the authorities you can get a better deal fabricating your own stuff.

H 484526
	I heard whatever took the gates offline destabilised all the jump holes out of the system too. The Xenos have been pretty agitated lately, I don't think they've been able to get supplies reliably on their usual routes.

H 484527
	What are the Xenos even still doing in this system? They got what they wanted with the gates down: no more foreign traffic in Liberty. I can't imagine the Navy will be keen to reopen any of the external gates anytime soon after what happened in Texas.

H 484528
	I'm on shore leave from the Rio Grande. We do a regular patrol along the trade lane from here up to Pueblo and I think it's fairly safe now. We have a pretty good route to stop the Xenos getting into Silverton and disrupting the trade lanes there. The supply run escort to the Galileo gate though? That's another matter.

H 484529
	We have a limited agreement with the Navy and Ageira to ship in pharmaceuticals via the New York gate once a day. It's still only partially operational, but nowhere in this system produces them so it's essential that we can keep a supply route open until normal trade can resume.

H 484530
	I've been stuck here since the gates went offline. Kusari didn't have the best of relations with Liberty, but at least there was trade. I've been thinking of trying to settle here. Even if they do get the route to Shikoku through the Independent Worlds established again, it might be years, and I may not even have a home to go back to.

H 484531
	We don't have full authorization to work openly in this system again yet. It's ridiculous they've authorised Freelancers but not the guild. We helped keep this system together when they were bringing in the Tamms.

H 484532
	If you're heading out to hunt Xenos, give the Cheyenne field a go. Usually you can find them alone or in pairs there and pick them off before their friends arrive. I think a lot of the less experienced pilots spend time there trying to scrape together resources for repairs as it's off the main Navy patrol routes.

H 484533
	I'm glad things have stabilised here. We had 5 months of panic when the gates shut off.You wouldn't believe it now but they were talking about rationing before Ageira got the New York gate working again.

H 484534
	I heard the Navy lost a whole patrol out near the Kepler gate last week, 4 fighters, just gone! They've adjusted the regular route out that way to keep clear of the debris field, but none of them will talk about what's going on there.

H 484535
	It was touch and go for the Rio Grande for a bit. They were on their last few barrels of MOX when the New York gate came back online. Losing the Rio would have been disastrous for Denver, it projects a huge amount of force and keeps the Xenos contained in the Alamosa and Copperton fields.

H 484546
	It's good to see miners in Silverton again. I know it's desperation on the part of the authorities but it takes me back to when Denver was just being settled and Colorado was the place to be for someone seeking their fortune.

H 484547
	With the LSF taking over New York's security entirely, we should have more resources to mop up what's left of the Xenos here soon.It's just been the Rio Grande and a handful of patrol frigates the last few months.

H 484548
	The LSF takeover has been a long time coming. Private interests on Manhattan have been trying to convince the administration that the system was 'safe' for decades. They didn't let up even when the war kicked off. Now the excuse is that the Navy's needed elsewhere. I don't buy it, we're not spread that thin!

H 484549
	Even though the LSF have said they'll handle any union action on Aurora we'll probably be asked to step in. The whole thing stinks of Xenos, which gives the administration the perfect excuse to get the Navy involved if anything kicks off in the Orbital Security Zone.

H 484550
	My CO's patrol went missing out by the Kepler debris field last week. The debris out there is too dense for a patrol frigate, and it's a long way for a fighter to fly without support. There's talk of shifting the patrol routes away from the field and just leaving it to the Xenos.

H 484551
	Colorado's not the worst place to be stuck. When the gates went down I had a friend who was posted to Los Angeles. They can't grow their own food in-system there so things got grim pretty quickly when the gates went offline. I don't know how things are going there now though, the news service has gone quiet and I've not heard from my friend for a few months.

H 484552
	We know the Xenos have a base in the Copperton Field. The Navy pushed them out of Silverton and smashed their base just before the war kicked off. They got too much time to entrench while we were off keeping the Rheinlanders at bay and now there's no way we could bring a patrol frigate or a cruiser to bear there and deal with them.

H 484553
	Even if the Navy could push the Xenos out of the system, there's no way they'd be rid of them completely. We're pretty sure they've got out-of-system bases, and they're brave or stupid enough to keep using jump holes we won't follow them into after Houston. No idea how they're getting supplies out that far.

H 484554
	We've not seen too much of the Rogues or Outcasts since the gates went down. The jump holes out the system are very unstable, but you can get through if you're lucky. I guess there isn't much here for them anymore, especially with the Xenos swelling their ranks from the unions on Denver.

H 484555
	We're here to have a chat with the Captain of the Rio and see if he'll give some of us permission to hunt in the Alamosa field. We've got authorization from the LPI around Tamms, but the Navy's been playing hard to get with patrol authorization this close to Denver.

H 484556
	After our base in the Silverton field got smashed we retreated here. Lucky for us Liberty decided to start a war. We've had over a year to prepare for the Navy's push against us now. We'll be ready.

H 484557
	The Navy and the Bounty Hunter's Guild don't dare follow us through the jump holes now. Whatever happened to the gates did something to them and now the stupid warnings Ageira puts out about them might actually have some merit. It's given us a space we can stage from free of Navy interference.

H 484558
	We don't get our supplies here directly from Denver very often. Our usual man comes in from New York, usually when we least expect him. The Navy don't seem to have the manpower to keep the Silverton Field well-patrolled, so we've got a good lifeline here for now.

H 484559
	There's always demand for small arms here. Even though we all share a common cause here, arguments are common. Usually whoever has the biggest gun comes off better.

H 484560
	They keep the bar nice for visitors, but the air on this station is rank. We have to bring in oxygen from elsewhere, so the recyclers on the decks below us are working at full capacity 24/7. It wouldn't be such a problem if we could get the parts to fix it, but we're running pretty old models here and sourcing them is hard, especially after the war.

H 484561
	Ageira's locked the navigation computers for most ships now so they can't use jump holes, but we've got a guy down on deck 7 who's figured out a way to get around it. We've lost a few guys going through them since Houston, but it's let us run rings around the Navy and the hunters.

H 484562
	Man I hate those patrol frigates. They've only got a few of them in-system at the moment, but they stop us really spending any time at all in open space. If they came into the field we'd make short work of them with our Trapdoor platforms, but they've been smart enough to just stay at the edges so far.

H 484563
	When the Xenos began, we were just miners who kept getting shafted by Liberty. There were fewer and fewer jobs as the years rolled by. Finally, there was nothing left for us, no jobs, not unless you could use a data pad instead of an auto-digger. All our jobs were being done by somebody in Rheinland or Kusari. Well, we decided to take back what had been taken from us

H 484564
	I heard they're working on a machine to temporarily stabilise jump holes up on level 8. The Navy have had a terrible time stamping out the Xenos in this system as they've been unwilling to use jump holes since the Houston Catastrophe.

H 484565
	Have you seen the new D-20 autocannons yet? They cut through unshielded ship panels like a hot knife through butter. R&D really took their time with this one, tons of improvements over the old D-18s they were running in the Texas conflict.

H 484566
	The technology stack for the nanite bursters is really odd. Most of it is proprietary and locked down, but what I have been able to get my hands on is unlike anything I've ever seen. The physics of it don't make sense. It seems decades ahead of what we have now, I have no idea how R&D cooked it up.

H 484567
	When the gates shut down, Ageira and DSE had to put their rivalries aside and team up to get everything running again. We pretty much run this station together now, although DSE keeps to their material science stuff and we stick to all the interesting problems.

H 484568
	I heard the teams over at the New York gate found something odd when they were repairing the link. There were rumours going around about a message on the subspace link-line, but management shut that down pretty quickly.

H 484569
	It took us months to get the gate back online after Houston. No-one had a clue what was going on and just diagnosing what was wrong was nearly impossible. On top of that we were contending with the damage done when the Kepler gate shattered. I heard a few convoys were out that way at the time and were unfortunate enough to get themselves caught in the blast radius. We got lucky here.

H 484570
	The new Lasers Ageira's pushed out are fantastic, like the energy weapons in old sci-fi shows we used to watch as kids. If we'd had these during the Texas conflict we would have pushed Rheinland right back into Hamburg in no time at all.

H 484571
	I got stuck out here when the gates went down like so many others. I had an authorised trade route from Leeds and should have been back months ago. I'm hoping they open the gates soon, but communications have been pretty locked down. I've not heard any word from headquarters, so I don't know if they even know I'm still alive.

H 484572
	This Liner was commissioned in a hurry and you can tell. The doors jam, the security systems don't work properly and the environmental systems have a minor failure every other week. It's a disaster waiting to happen.

H 484573
	The Xenos regularly attempt raids against Alcatraz, hoping to delay the completion of the station. Half the time when they're firing it's their own people stuck outside in vac-suits they're toasting. I can't tell if they're cold or just stupid. Maybe both.

H 484574
	Alcatraz looks pretty complete from the outside, but don't let that fool you, half the prison labour that should be building it ends up working production lines on this liner for the LPI. Half the alloys in Colorado must come through this place.

H 484575
	It's mostly Xenos in here now, but they've started bringing in petty criminals from Denver lately to make up for shortages. Those folks shouldn't be anywhere near a station like this, but I guess they're pretty keen to make sure Alcatraz gets done in time.

H 484576
	When it all kicks off over on Aurora, this place is going to fill up fast. We're understaffed as it is, I don't know how we'll cope with a sudden boom in the prison population here.

H 484577
	There's an escape attempt maybe every other week here. Last poor bastard got into the airlock and then ended up spacing himself when he saw his buddies outside get toasted by the static defences. Gotta say if I got stuck here I'd consider doing the same, there's no way out for a lot of them.

H 484578
	The loss of Texas was a huge blow to Liberty's labour force. So much alloy and hull panel manufacturing got blown away with Houston it's a wonder there's any ships left in space. I think the LPI wants to corner the market with Alcatraz here, a but like they did with Texas.

H 484579
	The LPI are pretty short-staffed, so a lot of guild members have been contracted out for security here. They pay on-station guard work pretty well, but I'd much rather be in space than on this old piece of junk.

	\m\bARTIFACTS\B
	\l
	Remnants of an alien civilization that existed long before humanity crawled from the ocean. The particulars of each individual Artifact vary, but archeologists and scientists have been unable to determine their function; for all intents and purposes, they appear to be inert chunks of crystal and metal inscribed with decorative patterns. A thriving market for Artifacts has sprung up over the years among art collectors and the social elite looking for a new status symbol.


H 483558 
	\m\bALIEN ORGANISMS \cr>>>HIGHLY PERISHABLE<<<\B\C
	\l
	A previously undiscovered bacterial lifeform unique to the Sirius Sector, these microorganisms are remarkably efficient at metabolizing certain elements into oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide. When seeded in an immature planetary environment they can accelerate the terraforming process tenfold, or provide a rich, abundant source of food for other organisms in more mature planetary ecosystems.

H 483559 
	\m\bBASIC ALLOYS\B
	\l
	Melding the strength of Titanium with the lightness of Aluminum, Basic Alloys can be used economically to construct durable machine parts. The non-ferrous nature of parts constructed from Basic Alloys and their resistance to oxidization makes them ideal for use in almost any manufacturing environment. When Basic Alloys are infused with a matrix of Boron fibers and combined with Super Alloys, the resulting material is then fabricated into the Ship Hull Panels used by shipyards throughout the colonies.

H 483560 
	\m\bBERYLLIUM\B
	\l
	In its processed metallic form, Beryllium is one of the lightest and stiffest naturally occurring materials known to science; unfortunately, it is also highly brittle, making unalloyed Beryllium unsuitable for most industrial processes. However, Beryllium was discovered to be extraordinarily effective at absorbing neutron radiation, and has since become a key component in the construction of modern reactors and engines.

H 483561 
	\m\bBORON\B
	\l
	Boron is an essential element in a number of industrial processes. In its fibrous form, Boron filaments are used as a stiffener in the creation of Ship Hull Panels, lending them unparalleled structural integrity. An isotope of Boron, Boron-10, is also used for control rods in the nuclear reactors that power large ships, stations, and planetside bases.

H 483562 
	\m\bCARDAMINE\B
	\l
	Cardamine is a drug that produces an intense sense of euphoria and energy in the user. It is both physically and psychologically addictive, but because users do not gain a tolerance, many simply dose themselves with Cardamine continuously to avoid the inevitable crash. Due to the genetic alterations caused by long-term Cardamine use, all of the major colonies have declared it contraband.

H 483563 
	\m\bCOBALT\B
	\l
	Thousands of years ago the distinctive coloration of Cobalt was used to create blue-tinged glass that was admired throughout the known world. Since that time, Cobalt has become recognized as a strategic metal with diverse military and commercial applications. Brittle in its unalloyed form, Cobalt Alloys exhibit tremendous hardness and resistance to corrosion. When combined with Niobium, the resulting High-Temperature Alloy can withstand even the intense heat and pressure generated by the combustion chamber of a fusion engine.

H 483564 
	\m\bCONSTRUCTION MACHINERY\B
	\l
	The speed with which planets have been settled over the last several centuries would not have been possible without the development of automated Construction Machinery. For higher-level planning, the real-time analysis of building specifications is combined with terrain and weather data transmitted from orbiting satellites. Autonomous software aboard each individual Construction Machine then executes the plan in the most efficient way possible based on local conditions.

H 483565 
	\m\bCONSUMER GOODS\B
	\l
	Once the basic necessities of survival have been met, most human beings look for ways to improve their life or to entertain themselves along the way. Consumer Goods satisfy these needs and include a broad range of relatively inexpensive bulk items such as clothing, toiletries, housewares, and Consumer Optronics. While most Consumer Goods are mass-produced in automated factories, the ongoing rise in the prison population within the colonies has yielded a cheap labor force that many governments have turned to for handmade goods.

H 483566 
	\m\bCOPPER\B
	\l
	Copper is a malleable, ductile, and essential component of room temperature Superconductors. Superconductors must be surrounded by shunt materials capable of carrying heavy currents around occasional Superconductor faults. For many of the same reasons that Copper was originally used in electrical wiring, it is an ideal shunt material in Niobium Superconductors. And, of course, Superconductors are an important component of modern Jump Gates and Trade Lanes.

H 483567 
	\m\bDIAMONDS\B
	\l
	Diamonds are the hardest natural substance known to modern science. Composed of a crystalline lattice of simple carbon formed under enormous heat and pressure, diamonds are an essential component of mining machinery, allowing saws and drills to cut through even the toughest asteroid or planetary crust. When properly cut and polished, however, the distinctive pattern of light refraction exhibited by diamonds results in the characteristic glittering, which has made them a hallmark of the rich and powerful elite.

H 483568 
	\m\bENGINE COMPONENTS\B
	\l
	Fusion engines generate thrust by superheating plasma in a magnetic bottle. The plasma is then emitted as exhaust through a nozzle assembly, providing thrust for even the largest of battleships. The temperatures and pressures exerted by a fusion engine require that their components be manufactured from High-Temperature Alloys, while Superconductors are necessary to generate the huge magnetic fields needed to contain the plasma.

H 483569 
	\m\bFERTILIZERS\B
	\l
	Fertilizers increase crop yields and enable plants to grow in planetary environments that lack the necessary nutrients due either to natural conditions or as a result of large-scale harvesting and grazing. Fertilizers are also a key component of the terraforming process, acting as a catalyst to accelerate the production of the self-sustaining plant ecologies that regulate climate and provide food for more advanced lifeforms.

H 483570 
	\m\bFOOD RATIONS\B
	\l
	Most planets in the Sirius Sector are rich in natural resources, but few are capable of supporting large-scale agriculture. As a result, Food remains one of the basic but essential inputs of the Sirius economy. While a large assortment of foodstuffs is available in the different colonies, Synth Foods has cornered much of the market with its revolutionary Synth Paste. However, the continuing expansion of the colonies guarantees that the ever-increasing demand for Food will keep the market open.

H 483571 
	\m\bGOLD\B
	\l
	Gold is the oldest precious metal known to humanity, initially prized for its smooth, shiny appearance, and later for its unique physical characteristics. Gold is the most malleable and ductile of all metals known. Combined with its high reflectivity to radiation and resistance to corrosion, gold has obvious applications in both the optronics and ship construction industries. Of course, the scarcity of gold — colony holdings of gold increase by only 1.2% per standard year — also makes it the ultimate status symbol for those who can afford it.

H 483572 
	\m\bH-FUEL\B
	\l
	H-fuel is the basic fuel used for engine propulsion everywhere in the colonies. A mix of elemental hydrogen, deuterium (H2), and helium-3 (He3), H-fuel can also be mixed with oxygen in fuel cells to provide water (via 'cracking') and electricity for smaller ships, space stations, and other facilities. H-fuel production is almost totally monopolized by the Kusari who obtain their supplies from the Gas Miners Guild before shipping it to storage depots and distribution facilities throughout the colonies.

H 483573 
	\m\bHIGH-TEMPERATURE ALLOY\B
	\l
	High-temperature alloys are essential to the construction of engine components: only a material with the strength of cobalt and the temperature resistance of niobium could withstand the tremendous amount of heat and pressure that exists within the combustion chamber of a fusion engine. However, the rarity of niobium and the complex fabrication methods employed mean that high-temperature alloys are relatively expensive — but without them, modern space travel would be impossible.

H 483574 
	\m\bHYDROCARBONS\B
	\l
	Hydrocarbons are a class of organic compounds composed only of hydrogen and carbon molecules, resulting in a wide variety of substances that have important industrial applications. While hydrocarbons naturally occur in a gaseous state almost everywhere in the known universe, frozen deposits present the most easily exploited form of the substance. Hydrocarbon mining is key to the industrialization of the Sirius Sector as it provides the raw materials for the creation of the Ship Hull Panels and Optronics, upon which modern society depends.

H 483575 
	\m\bLUXURY CONSUMER GOODS\B
	\l
	There are always those with money or influence who demand items that will set them apart from — and above — those without their resources. For such individuals, Luxury Consumer Goods offer the ultimate status symbol and include big-ticket items such as jewelry, designer clothes, and advanced Optronics. All of these items are valuable precisely because they are rare, often fabricated from the most uncommon or difficult-to-obtain resources in the Sirius Sector.

H 483576 
	\m\bLUXURY FOOD \cr>>>HIGHLY PERISHABLE<<<\B\C
	\l
	The first colonists found strange planets full of unknown flora and fauna, much of it indigestible or even toxic to human beings. As time passed, though, the colonists grew more confident about which indigenous life forms were both nutritional and flavorful, while some gene-banked plants and animals unexpectedly flourished in their new environments. Such delicacies quickly became some of the most popular and expensive imports from the worlds that produced them.

H 483577 
	\m\bMINING MACHINERY\B
	\l
	Much of the rich resources of the Sirius Sector are locked within barren planetoids or buried beneath the crust of an airless, frozen planet. By combining super-hard Diamond drill bits and advanced sensor arrays, however, even the deepest deposits can be excavated with relative ease. When used in conjunction with automated crushers, grinders, and sifters, a complete mining operation manned by only a few key personnel can rip apart an average-sized asteroid within a matter of standard weeks.

	\m\bMOX \cr>>>PERISHABLE<<<\B\C
	\l
	A mixture of uranium oxide (UO2) and a small (<3%) portion of weapons-grade plutonium, MOX is the primary fuel for the nuclear reactors used aboard large spacecraft and the monstrous blast furnaces of manufacturing platforms. MOX is typically formed into ceramic pellets that are then loaded into zirconium fuel elements and packaged for transport. It is an efficient source of energy that utilizes a large percentage of recycled materials and exhibits only trace radiation, thus posing little threat to the environment.

H 483579 
	\m\bNIOBIUM\B
	\l
	Rare and exotic, Niobium has a number of unique properties. Relatively light and extremely heat resistant, Niobium-derived alloys have been used in the construction of spacecraft and nuclear reactors for centuries, while at lower temperatures Niobium acts as an effective Superconductor. But aside from its practical uses, Niobium is also visually distinctive. When anodized using an electric current, Niobium turns a range of iridescent colors. This property makes it a natural subject for the jeweler’s art.

H 483580 
	\m\bOPTICAL CHIPS\B
	\l
	The Optical Chip is a tiny electronic component featuring a general-purpose array of optical switches that can be programmed and instantly reprogrammed to perform nearly any function. Rather than using electricity, however, beams of light transfer information almost instantly, making general-purpose stateless computing machines possible. Optical Chips are the core components in the new field of Optronics on which all advanced technology is based.

H 483581 
	\m\bOPTRONICS\B
	\l
	By stringing together arrays of adaptable Optical Chips connected with gossamer-thin webs of organically spun glass waveguides, a new type of computing machine was created. These Optronic devices utilize almost no moving parts, consume very little power, and operate at the speed of light. Because Optical Chips can almost instantly reprogram themselves, Optronics excel at the kind of signal processing and computation that underlie a host of practical applications ranging from Consumer Goods to ship avionics.

H 483582 
	\m\bOXYGEN\B
	\l
	A typical human being consumes over 12,000 liters of Oxygen (O2) daily. Oxygen, usually mixed with a neutral gas such as nitrogen, is absorbed through the tissues of the lungs and then diffused into the bloodstream, where it is carried throughout the body. All humans require a constant supply of Oxygen or they will perish within minutes.

H 483583 
	\m\bPHARMACEUTICALS\B
	\l
	Advanced pharmaceutical research has now yielded an entirely new class of custom-tailored drugs. Using scanners and optronic computers, scientists can determine the precise molecular structure required for a drug to be most effective in treating a particular disease or affliction. The resulting drug is then assembled molecule by molecule from raw polymers; however, prototype drugs must be researched in zero-g to avoid the effects of gravitational pull which could disturb the delicate process.

H 483584 
	\m\bPOLYMERS\B
	\l
	A polymer is a large molecule of high relative molecular mass composed of five or more monomers, smaller molecular structures repeated over and over to form the polymer. While the simplest of polymers have only five monomers, typical polymers contain hundreds or thousands of monomers, and some advanced polymers stretch into chains of millions. Because of their physical and chemical characteristics, polymers have a tremendous range of uses and are ubiquitous within the technology and consumer products industries.

H 483585 
	\m\bSCRAP METAL\B
	\l
	The rapid industrialization that followed the settlement of the Sirius Sector has resulted in large fields of Scrap Metal, the detritus resulting from extensive manufacturing and mining operations. These debris fields present both a navigational hazard and a potential second-stage resource, so a small cottage industry has sprung up among those who collect scrap metal and resell it at smelting plants.

H 483586 
	\m\bSHIP HULL PANELS\B
	\l
	One of the most important pieces of technology developed during the course of settling the Sirius Sector has been Ship Hull Panels. These wonders of materials research combine a Polymer and Hydrocarbon base along with Basic and Super Alloys to create a substance that is light and flexible, while providing insulation from hard vacuum and all but the most intense radiation. Boron fibers are infused into the panels to endow them with structural rigidity, protecting ships against kinetic impact and high-energy weapons fire.

H 483587 
	\m\bLIGHT ARMS\B
	\l
	Light Arms include a wide array of portable weapons intended for personal defense, ranging from handheld blasters to shoulder-mounted needler rifles. While not suited to major military offensives, this line of weaponry is more than adequate for protecting oneself in close quarters combat. And with piracy on the rise throughout the colonies, the need for protection has never been greater.

	\m\bPOLYMERS\B
	\l
	A polymer is a large molecule of high relative molecular mass composed of five or more monomers, smaller molecular structures repeated over and over to form the polymer. While the simplest of polymers have only five monomers, typical polymers contain hundreds or thousands of monomers, and some advanced polymers stretch into chains of millions. Because of their physical and chemical characteristics, polymers have a tremendous range of uses and are ubiquitous within the technology and consumer products industries.

H 483589 
	\m\bSILVER\B
	\l
	Silver has long been valued by humanity for its beauty, scarcity, and broad spectrum of uses. One of the most important uses for Silver today, however, is in terraforming. Silver iodide (AgI) is employed as a cloud-seeding agent to catalyze nascent ecologies by encouraging the production of rain. Silver also remains highly desirable for its aesthetic beauty, accessorizing the suit of many a technocrat or the arm of a society matron.

H 483590 
	\m\bSUPERCONDUCTORS\B
	\l
	Superconductors are materials that transmit without loss any current applied to them. Unfortunately, many materials act as superconductors only when cooled to temperatures near absolute zero. The discovery of 'room temperature' superconductors built around a core of specially treated niobium with copper shunting, however, made possible quantum leaps in technology. Most importantly, superconductors are key components in fusion engines and in the construction of Jump Gates and Trade Lanes.

H 483591 
	\m\bTERRAFORMING GASES\B
	\l
	The injection of gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs) into the atmosphere of a developing planet is an essential first step in the terraforming process. These greenhouse gases trap solar heat and raise the mean temperature to a sufficient level where a self-sustaining ecology can be initiated. PFCs are up to 10,000 times more effective than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas, but they do not occur naturally in planetary environments, and large quantities must be transported to any planet undergoing terraforming.

H 483592 
	\m\bTOXIC WASTE\B
	\l
	The inevitable byproduct of many of the industrial processes used by the different colonies is Toxic Waste. While some companies specialize in waste removal or elimination, many companies still use the more basic but still effective method of simply dumping Toxic Waste into the nearest available stellar body.

H 483593 
	\m\bJUMP GATE / TRADE LANE PARTS\B
	\l
	Jump Gate and Trade Lane Parts are exclusively manufactured at the Ageira Technologies facility in the Colorado System and are delivered to individual construction sites as necessary. These components are sealed in scanner-proof, tamper-proof white boxes that can only be opened with complex biometric keys. The boxes are also designed to detonate if opened outside of an authorized facility. Additional security measures are confidential, but Ageira has never failed to recover a missing white box.

H 483594 
	\m\bWATER\B
	\l
	Dihydrogen monoxide (H2O) is odorless, tasteless, transparent, and absolutely essential to human life. Roughly 75% of the human body is composed of Water. Deprived of Water, most humans can only live three days. The process of dehydration is a painful one, as tissues shrivel and vessels shrink in a desperate bid by the dying body to preserve its remaining vital functions.
